Taken together this federation of 47 charities is known as The Wildlife Trusts. </p> <p><br /></p> <p>The next few years will be critical in determining what kind of world we all live in. We need to urgently reverse the loss of wildlife and put nature into recovery at scale if we are to prevent climate and ecological disaster.
