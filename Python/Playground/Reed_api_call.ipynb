We have more than 944,000 members, over 38,000 volunteers, 3,600 staff and 600 trustees.

Taken together this federation of 47 charities is known as The Wildlife Trusts. </p> <p><br /></p> <p>The next few years will be critical in determining what kind of world we all live in.

We have more than 944,000 members, over 38,000 volunteers, 3,600 staff and 600 trustees.  There are 46 individual Wildlife Trusts, each of which is a place-based independent charity with its own legal identity, formed by groups of people getting together and working with others to make a positive difference to wildlife and future generations, starting  where they live and work. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Every Wildlife Trust is part of The Wildlife Trusts federation and a corporate member of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, a registered charity in its own right founded in 1912 and one of the founding members of IUCN – the International Union for the  Conservation of Nature. Taken together this federation of 47 charities is known as The Wildlife Trusts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The next few years will be critical in determining what kind of world we all live in. We need to urgently reverse the loss of wildlife and put nature into recovery at scale if we are to prevent climate and ecological disaster. We recognise that this will  require big, bold changes in the way The Wildlife Trusts work, not least in how we mobilise others and support them to organise within their own communities. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About You &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Data Engineer, you will play a crucial role in supporting the work of The Wildlife Trusts by maintaining and enhancing our data pipelines and infrastructure. You will be responsible for ensuring the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the federation  wide data service system, a data lakehouse, providing key insights and solutions to support decision-making across the organisation and federation, responding to the needs of Wildlife Trusts and the delivery of our 2030 Strategy. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Working collaboratively with various teams, you will develop data management solutions, new use cases, forecast data volumes, and ensure cost-effective service maintenance. You will be integral in enabling us to leverage data for operational and strategic  success and in supporting an excellent community of practice within the federation of Wildlife Trusts. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;As Data Engineer, you will be responsible for managing and optimising data pipelines, cloud services, and providing data-driven solutions to support business needs. To excel in this role, you should be highly motivated, detail-oriented, and passionate about  people focused data engineering and analysis. You will have experience in a data engineering role, ideally with practical experience or the ability to upskill in cloud services like Azure, Databricks and ESRI, as well as excellent proven proficiency, SQL and  Python. Ideally you would have a familiarity with developing pipelines which support Analysts who use RStudio Power BI and/or GIS. You will have experience or the ability to up-skill in administering data services linked to the Data Lakehouse wholistically,  such as GitHub, Power BI. &lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will work closely with and on behalf of teams across the Wildlife Trusts to ensure our data systems are secure, optimised, scalable, and cost-efficient.

As the business looks to modernise their operations and systems, they are embarking on a significant  transformation programme to replace their legacy SAP system with best-of-breed ERP solutions. To support this, they are recruiting their first &lt;strong&gt;Business Analyst&lt;/strong&gt; - a vital role that will help bridge the gap between IT and business teams to ensure they successfully capture, design, and deliver future-fit business processes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Business Analyst will play a central role in the ERP transformation journey.

Beyond the ERP programme, you will also help embed a more structured approach  to process documentation and improvement across the organisation, building a foundation of operational competence that will benefit the business long term.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About the role&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Key accountabilities:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Work collaboratively with business teams to uncover, map, and document existing ('as-is') business processes, systems, and touchpoints, using clear, detailed and visual process maps.

Identify business value; benefit; usefulness and importance to business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Work with stakeholders and project teams to design 'to-be' business processes and workflows aligned to business objectives, operational needs, ERP capabilities and best practice.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Translate process blueprints into robust, unambiguous functional specifications to support software providers in configuring solutions that fit the businesses requirements.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Collaborate with IT, third-party suppliers, and business leads to ensure accurate system configuration and design.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support change management activities by ensuring stakeholders understand process changes and by providing process documentation for training and onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Support change impact analysis and contribute to testing, training, and rollout activities.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Champion the creation and ongoing maintenance of an operational knowledge model, ensuring that business process information is systematically captured, documented, and made accessible to prevent future knowledge loss.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Develop and maintain business process documentation and contribute to the creation of an internal process library or knowledge base.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Promote business analysis best practices and help shape future capability within the organisation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;To become an integral part of the project delivery function ensuring that regular reviews are undertaken as to the effectiveness of the proposed processes and implementation. &lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;About you&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Experience: &lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Proven experience as a Business Analyst in complex change or ERP migration projects.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Demonstrable expertise in business process mapping, modelling, and documentation (using tools such as Visio or similar).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong analytical, facilitation, and communication skills, with the ability to uncover requirements where knowledge is lacking and present complex processes clearly to diverse audiences.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience in translating processes into functional specifications for technology configuration and implementation.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Contribute to the definition of governance frameworks and standards for business process documentation within the Business.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Highly organised, detail-oriented, and proactive, with a collaborative approach to problem solving.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Skills &amp;amp; attributes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Ability to create comprehensive, up-to-date process maps and blueprints available to business and IT stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Ability to translate business requirements into functional specifications for technical teams and suppliers.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Able to ensure that operational process knowledge retained and accessible for future reference and onboarding.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience working remotely and face to face with cross-functional teams, including finance, procurement, HR, and operations.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Strong written and verbal communication skills.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Comfortable working independently and in a newly established role.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;Desirable:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;Experience working with SAP or other ERP systems.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Familiarity with business process modelling tools (e.g., BPMN, Visio, Lucidchart).&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Experience with knowledge management and building process documentation frameworks.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt; &lt;p&gt;At Gleeson Recruitment Group, we embrace inclusivity and welcome applicants of all backgrounds, experiences, and abilities.

We have more than 944,000 members, over 38,000 volunteers, 3,600 staff and 600 trustees.  There are 46 individual Wildlife Trusts, each of which is a place-based independent charity with its own legal identity, formed by groups of people getting together and working with others to make a positive difference to wildlife and future generations, starting  where they live and work. </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Every Wildlife Trust is part of The Wildlife Trusts federation and a corporate member of the Royal Society of Wildlife Trusts, a registered charity in its own right founded in 1912 and one of the founding members of IUCN – the International Union for the  Conservation of Nature. Taken together this federation of 47 charities is known as The Wildlife Trusts. </p> <p><br /></p> <p>The next few years will be critical in determining what kind of world we all live in. We need to urgently reverse the loss of wildlife and put nature into recovery at scale if we are to prevent climate and ecological disaster. We recognise that this will  require big, bold changes in the way The Wildlife Trusts work, not least in how we mobilise others and support them to organise within their own communities. </p> <p><br /></p> <p><strong>About You </strong></p> <p><br /></p> <p>As Data Engineer, you will play a crucial role in supporting the work of The Wildlife Trusts by maintaining and enhancing our data pipelines and infrastructure. You will be responsible for ensuring the effectiveness, efficiency, and scalability of the federation  wide data service system, a data lakehouse, providing key insights and solutions to support decision-making across the organisation and federation, responding to the needs of Wildlife Trusts and the delivery of our 2030 Strategy. </p> <p><br /></p> <p>Working collaboratively with various teams, you will develop data management solutions, new use cases, forecast data volumes, and ensure cost-effective service maintenance. You will be integral in enabling us to leverage data for operational and strategic  success and in supporting an excellent community of practice within the federation of Wildlife Trusts. </p> <p><br /></p> <p>As Data Engineer, you will be responsible for managing and optimising data pipelines, cloud services, and providing data-driven solutions to support business needs. To excel in this role, you should be highly motivated, detail-oriented, and passionate about  people focused data engineering and analysis. You will have experience in a data engineering role, ideally with practical experience or the ability to upskill in cloud services like Azure, Databricks and ESRI, as well as excellent proven proficiency, SQL and  Python. Ideally you would have a familiarity with developing pipelines which support Analysts who use RStudio Power BI and/or GIS.
